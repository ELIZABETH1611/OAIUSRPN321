Procedure to Build 5G-NSA with OAI

The steps to install the OAI to deploy a 5G-NSA network are detailed as follows:

1) Clone OAI code from git server.
$ sudo apt-get install git
$ git clone https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/\diagup oai/\diagup openairinterface5g.git

2) Browse to the folder named "openairinterface5g" and switch to the "Develop" branch
$ git checkout develop
A message will appear in the console indicating that it has switched properly to the branch.
$ source oaienv
Now, the OAI software is installed on the server and ready to be compiled.

3) Browse to the folder "cmake_targets" located inside openairinterface5g and execute
$ sudo ./build_oai -I -w URSP --eNB --gNB --UE
- I installs software and libraries required for OAI (only mandatory on first build)
-w USRP installs the radio software requirements
--eNB and --gNB build the libraries for LTE and NR, creating the executables lte-softmodem and nr-softmodem
--UE builds an UE simulator
